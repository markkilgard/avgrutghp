Our contributions for GPU-acceleration are best understood in contrast
with Illustrator's pre-existing CPU rendering approach.
All but a cursory description of Illustrator's CPU rendering approach is beyond the scope of this paper.
Illustrator's CPU rendering closely follows the PDF standard \cite{PDF-Spec}.
AGM's CPU renderer
relies on a robust, expertly-tuned, but reasonably conventional active edge list algorithm
\cite{Foley:1990:CGP:83821}
for rasterizing arbitrary paths including B\'{e}zier segments \cite{TurnerFreeType2}.
Table \ref{table:framebuffer-compare} lists the differences between the CPU and GPU approaches in
organizing the framebuffer storage for rendering.
Table~\ref{table:rendering-compare} lists the ways rendering is different between the CPU and GPU approaches.

\ifdefined\NOSHOW
When the requirements for GPU-acceleration are met by the system, both CPU and GPU rendering are available.
%Figure~\ref{fig:gpu-performance-preferences} shows the ``GPU Performance'' panel.
The user can quickly toggle between the two rendering modes with a
keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-E) or the {\em View$\rightarrow$GPU Preview}
pulldown menu toggle option.  This ability to toggle the CPU versus GPU renderer
makes it easily for users (and Quality Assurance engineers)
to confirm they render essentially identical results---though not exactly pixel-for-pixel identical.
The tab above each artwork window ``GPU Preview'' when its contents are GPU rendered as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}.
