%Designers and artists worldwide rely on \AdobeIllustrator/ to edit vector graphics content.
We describe our successful initiative to accelerate
Adobe
\Illustrator/ with the graphics hardware pipeline of modern GPUs.
Relying on  OpenGL 4.4 plus recent OpenGL extensions for
advanced blend modes and first-class GPU-accelerated path rendering, we
accelerate the \AdobeGraphicsModel/ (\AGM/) layer responsible for rendering
sophisticated \Illustrator/ scenes.  \Illustrator/ documents render in
either an RGB or CMYK color mode.  While GPUs are designed and optimized
for RGB rendering, we orchestrate OpenGL rendering of vector content
in the proper CMYK color space and accommodate the 5+ color components
required.  We support both non-isolated and isolated transparency groups, knockout,
patterns, and arbitrary path clipping.  We harness GPU
tessellation to shade paths smoothly with gradient meshes.  We do all this
and render complex \Illustrator/ scenes 2 to 6x faster than CPU rendering
at Full HD resolutions; and 5 to 16x faster at Ultra HD resolutions.
